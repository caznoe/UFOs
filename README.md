# UFOs

 The goal of the project was to present a provided json file of UFO data and create an HTML interface to filter the data. Using JavaScript, I wrote a couple functions for the data to be presented in a table and, using D3 to listen for filter clicks, allow users to filter the date. In the HTML code, Bootstrap was used to format the information and set up the presented table along with the filter button. Bootstrap elements were also used to customize the header and create a navigation bar. Another step for the site would be to clean the comment field for formatting or look at including a scraping function to have more current data available.
